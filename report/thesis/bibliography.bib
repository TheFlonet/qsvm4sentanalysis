    abstract={The rapid growth of Internet-based applications, such as social media platforms and blogs, has resulted in comments and reviews concerning day-to-day activities. Sentiment analysis is the process of gathering and analyzing people's opinions, thoughts, and impressions regarding various topics, products, subjects, and services. People's opinions can be beneficial to corporations, governments, and individuals for collecting information and making decisions based on opinion. However, the sentiment analysis and evaluation procedure face numerous challenges. These challenges create impediments to accurately interpreting sentiments and determining the appropriate sentiment polarity. Sentiment analysis identifies and extracts subjective information from the text using natural language processing and text mining. This article discusses a complete overview of the method for completing this task as well as the applications of sentiment analysis. Then, it evaluates, compares, and investigates the approaches used to gain a comprehensive understanding of their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, the challenges of sentiment analysis are examined in order to define future directions.},

    abstract = {Sentiment analysis in Twitter is a field that has recently attracted research interest. Twitter is one of the most popular microblog platforms on which users can publish their thoughts and opinions. Sentiment analysis in Twitter tackles the problem of analyzing the tweets in terms of the opinion they express. This survey provides an overview of the topic by investigating and briefly describing the algorithms that have been proposed for sentiment analysis in Twitter. The presented studies are categorized according to the approach they follow. In addition, we discuss fields related to sentiment analysis in Twitter including Twitter opinion retrieval, tracking sentiments over time, irony detection, emotion detection, and tweet sentiment quantification, tasks that have recently attracted increasing attention. Resources that have been used in the Twitter sentiment analysis literature are also briefly presented. The main contributions of this survey include the presentation of the proposed approaches for sentiment analysis in Twitter, their categorization according to the technique they use, and the discussion of recent research trends of the topic and its related fields.},

    abstract={We show that the NP-hard quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem on a graph G can be solved using an adiabatic quantum computer that implements an Ising spin-1/2 Hamiltonian, by reduction through minor-embedding of G in the quantum hardware graph U. There are two components to this reduction: embedding and parameter setting. The embedding problem is to find a minor-embedding Gembof a graph G in U, which is a subgraph of U such that G can be obtained from Gembby contracting edges. The parameter setting problem is to determine the corresponding parameters, qubit biases and coupler strengths, of the embedded Ising Hamiltonian. In this paper, we focus on the parameter setting problem. As an example, we demonstrate the embedded Ising Hamiltonian for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem via adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) using an Ising spin-1/2 system. We close by discussing several related algorithmic problems that need to be investigated in order to facilitate the design of adiabatic algorithms and AQC architectures.},

In this paper, we implemented the Support Vector Machines (SVM) model in classifying English text and documents. Here we did two analytical experiments to check the selected classifiers using English documents. Experimental results performed on a set of 1033 text document present that the Rocchio classifier provides the best performance results when the size of the feature set is small while SVM outperforms the other classifiers. From the experimental analysis, we observed that the classification rate exceeds 90\% when using more than 4000 features.}}
