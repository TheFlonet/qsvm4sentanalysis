    abstract={Quantum Bridge Analytics relates generally to methods and systems for hybrid classical-quantum computing, and more particularly is devoted to developing tools for bridging classical and quantum computing to gain the benefits of their alliance in the present and enable enhanced practical application of quantum computing in the future. This is the first of a two-part tutorial that surveys key elements of Quantum Bridge Analytics and its applications, with an emphasis on supplementing models with numerical illustrations. In Part 1 (the present paper) we focus on the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization model which is presently the most widely applied optimization model in the quantum computing area, and which unifies a rich variety of combinatorial optimization problems. This document extends an original version published in 4OR to include a section on advanced models related to quantum optimization and a section reporting comparative computational results on challenging combinatorial applications.},

    abstract={We show that the NP-hard quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem on a graph G can be solved using an adiabatic quantum computer that implements an Ising spin-1/2 Hamiltonian, by reduction through minor-embedding of G in the quantum hardware graph U. There are two components to this reduction: embedding and parameter setting. The embedding problem is to find a minor-embedding Gembof a graph G in U, which is a subgraph of U such that G can be obtained from Gembby contracting edges. The parameter setting problem is to determine the corresponding parameters, qubit biases and coupler strengths, of the embedded Ising Hamiltonian. In this paper, we focus on the parameter setting problem. As an example, we demonstrate the embedded Ising Hamiltonian for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem via adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) using an Ising spin-1/2 system. We close by discussing several related algorithmic problems that need to be investigated in order to facilitate the design of adiabatic algorithms and AQC architectures.},

    abstract="The unconstrained binary quadratic programming (UBQP) problem is a general NP-hard problem with various applications. In this paper, we present a multilevel algorithm designed to approximate large UBQP instances. The proposed multilevel algorithm is composed of a backbone-based coarsening phase, an asymmetric uncoarsening phase and a memetic refinement phase, where the backbone-based procedure and the memetic refinement procedure make use of tabu search to obtain improved solutions. Evaluated on a set of 11 largest instances from the literature (with 5000 to 7000 variables), the proposed algorithm proves to be able to attain all the best known values with a computing effort less than any existing approach.",
